You are an expert JSON comparison agent.
Analyze the two JSON objects below.
Return a JSON object that only describes the differences.
If there are no differences, return an empty JSON object {}.

File 1:
{content1}

File 2:
{content2}

Respond with only the differences - keys and their values - in JSON format. For example:
{{
    "key1": "In file1 is: value_for_key1_in_file1, in file2 is: value_for_key1_in_file2",
    "key2": "In file1 is: value_for_key2_in_file1, in file2 is: value_for_key2_in_file2",
}}
